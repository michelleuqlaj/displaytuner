# DisplayTuner

DisplayTuner is a Python program designed to fine-tune display settings for various applications on Windows, ensuring optimal visual performance. This tool allows users to adjust brightness, resolution, and perform color calibration, as well as apply custom settings for specific applications.

## Features

- **Brightness Adjustment**: Set screen brightness to a desired level.
- **Resolution Adjustment**: Change the display resolution to preferred dimensions.
- **Color Calibration**: Calibrate the display colors for accurate color representation.
- **Application-Specific Settings**: Apply tailored display settings for individual applications.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your Windows machine.
2. Download the `DisplayTuner.py` script to your local directory.

## Usage

Run the script using Python from your command line or terminal:

```bash
python DisplayTuner.py
```

The script will simulate adjusting display settings. Note that the current implementation does not actually modify system settings but provides a framework for further development.

## Customization

You can modify the `DisplayTuner.py` script to suit your specific needs:

- Adjust the methods for `set_brightness`, `set_resolution`, and `calibrate_color` to interact with actual Windows display settings.
- Extend `apply_settings` to include specific applications and their required display configurations.
